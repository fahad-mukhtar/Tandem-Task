# Tandem-Task
First of all, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity, I have successfully finished the task and I can proudly say that I am a passionate android developer, and I took this task as a challenge and a learning experience. I completed the task using kotlin, coroutines and Jetpack libraries. For pagination I have used the Android Paging library 3 and for state management I used SharedPreferences. I implemented the whole task using MVVM architecture. I have written following test cases to test the RecyclerView.
1.	Test to click on a particular index.
2.	Scroll Test for RecylerView.

To test the Api response I have integrated MockWebServer and conducted the following tests:

1.	Test to validate response.
2.	Test to check the page size (number of items).
3.	Test the content of the Api

I am very excited and looking forward to be part of an amazing team.
